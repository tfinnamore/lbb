## Official Thoughts  

Thoughts about what i'm going to includes

* ALL SUBMITTED DATA NEEDS TO STAY LOCAL
* LDAP Auth
* Select2 for a tagging system
* Images will be attached to articles, not inline
* Need moderator abilities
* Allow the poster of an article to edit it
* Each comment has one article, each article has many comments
* Sent email to poster when a comment is added (Make it opt-in?)
* File Uploader should pass the article ID when it ajax POSTs the files, or wait until the form is submitted and POST with the form
* Deal with XSS somehow (blade? HTMLPurifier?)
* Basic profile with picture?
